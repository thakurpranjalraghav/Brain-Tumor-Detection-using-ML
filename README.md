brain tumor detection using ML
This presents a model which is based on machine learning algorithms to detect brain tumors from magnetic resonance images with high accuracy. A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) has been used as the algorithm for feature extraction, and segmentation. The dataset used has been acquired from an internet website. The results show that this technique is promising and the accuracy of 97.79% has been achieved.
